Hey all, apologies for the slight delay - I've been thinking deeply on how 
we can pull this off as clean as possible and took the liberty of laying
out some starting code for both the front and back end.

As Sam suggested, I agree we should start with the back end as this will 
require the most thought; then the front is just a matter of linking and
clearly communicating what is going on.

We'll obviously be using git so I strongly suggest checking out this video 
playlist https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEGIFZDyszA&list=PL6gx4Cwl9DGAKWClAD_iKpNC0bGHxGhcx
if you feel a refresh is in order - I definitely needed one.

Here is the repo we'll be working on https://github.com/yohanderose/Dunedin_Railways_Systems
Fork yourselves a copy to work on and push when done. 

Below I've outlined some tasks for completion and suggested who might
work on them. Please feel free (you too Professors and Ben) to edit this README
document and the checklist below. In addition to git, some tech we are using
include sqlite3 (standard with python), flask and bootstrap for html stuff.
Give app.py a run in UserEnd to see how it looks and also check out sarah.py
in the AdminEnd and familiarise yourselves with the structure of the program.
Everything we're using is pretty friendly, but if google isn't helping with 
understanding something do send a message my way. Also lets stick to atom
as agreed.

The goal over the next two weeks guys is to make something that works, not
too sophisticated or flashy - just minimal and bug free. From there we can start
to think about more features and scalability etc. 

Jobs
	Back:
	- watch the git video series and get really familiar with using github
	- create a RDBMS to model our entities (Sam), check this out - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pd-0G0MigUA
	- derive an algorithm that distributes volunteers into carriages (Sweta)
	- populate the DB with pretend instances and check if algorithm sorts them correctly (Yohan)
	
	Front:
	- work on the Volunteer tab (Yohan)
	- work on the About Me tab (Sweta + Sam) 

Remember this is for fun dudes, so if you really want a job, need help
or clarification - shoot over to the fb groupchat or github and chuck us a 
message.
